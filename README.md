# Graph-Coloring--DAA-Project
- Graph coloring is a problem in graph theory that involves assigning colors to the vertices of a graph, subject to certain constraints. The goal is to color the vertices of the graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
- The problem of graph coloring has a wide range of applications in computer science, operations research, and other fields. For example, it can be used to model scheduling problems, map coloring problems, and register allocation in compilers.
- In addition to its practical applications, graph coloring is also an important area of research in theoretical computer science. There are many interesting and unsolved problems related to graph coloring, such as the chromatic number of a graph (the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph), and the complexity of coloring graphs with specific structures or properties.
- Here we will Use coding to perform graph coloring and show its outputs
